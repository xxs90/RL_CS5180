# Exercise 5: Temporal-Difference Learning

## Setup

* SWIG (gym[box2d] dependency, see http://www.swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIGDocumentation.html#Preface_installation)
* Python 3.5+ (for type hints)

Install requirements with the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Assignment

We will use Jupyter Notebook for this assignment. Unlike previous assignments, everyone must use and complete this notebook (i.e. please do not submit your own code). Before running the notebook, make sure the requirements are fulfilled.

### Submission 

Please submit your complete notebook to Canvas. A separate written pdf is not required; any explanations will be written inside the notebook as markdown cells. You must make sure that your notebook contains only the requested exercises and does not contain any debug or print statements. It should run completely from start to end, without errors. 

## Code

Fill in the sections marked `YOUR CODE HERE`. First run a jupyter notebook instance with the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
and edit the notebook. Note that this notebook uses some widgets that are incompatible with `jupyter-lab`.
